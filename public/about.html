<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My names are Isaac Ajunam-John. I was born on the 19th of November 2001 and I'm a fullstack web developer. Across my career I've had work experience and built projects for conglomerates within the tech space like Oracle, Meta, Tesla, Google etc. And I'm proof that consistent hardwork and practice makes absolutely perfect because all my work I've put on here wouldn't have been achieved without the right work ethics and right amount of determination. I am very passionate about anything related to my area of expertise and I give my absolute all to any project I'm part of. I've properly laid out all my projects for you to assess as you see fit and I hope they impress you and I hope to hear from you soon! </p>
