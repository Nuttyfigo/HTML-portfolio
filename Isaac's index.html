<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Top Boy:</h3>
<p>A very thrilling insight into the UK Gang culture. Now this series doesn't glorify gang violence per say, it just exquisuitely narrates what happens when people are exposed to unfortunate societal circumstances like poverty, lack of a father figure, an overworked single mother and a lot more. I'll rank this at the top of my review list because the story itself is so thrilling and I personally have been a big big fan of the show and it's cast members off camera. So I'll quit the rambling before I blow the hype out of porportion.</p>

<h3>Game Of Thrones:</h3>
<p>Under normal circumstances this would have undoubtedly sealed the number one spot but under present circumstances it'll have to make do with the second spot. Set in George R.R Martin's fictional Westeros this blockbuster kicks off after the death of the current King of Westeros Robert Beratheon, his trusted Lord Hand Eddard Stark gets caught up in a political whirlwind that includes : children born of incest, siblings laying rightful claims to the throne, and a vicious queen who's hellbent on seeing her son ascend the throne. The political whirlwind as described set off the chain of events we"ll later come to be familiar with as the "Game of Thrones."  </p>

<h3>Power:</h3>
<p>Again another Crime/Thriller makes it into the my top 3. I know you might be silently questioning why I included another Crime/Thriler in my top 3 having already put "Top Boy" at number one.
